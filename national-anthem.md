May you live long and prosper, Ind. Rep. of the ^3!
Oh Ind. Rep. of the ^3! may God uphold thee,

We lay our future in thy hand.
Oh, bright dawn of May
Our mother Ind. Rep. of the ^3

We are sons of your rocks
And keepers of your honesty
Refuge of the glorious monastic and civil traditions,

Our nation is eternal, our reign prosperous,
The enlightenment teachings thrive and flourish,
May the sun of peace and happiness shine upon the people!
Receive our grateful praise sublime.

No more our ancient sireland,
Shall shelter the despot or tired,
Despite a thousand trials our courage is unshaken.

From your old and hard chains
You forged, with an ire-driven hand,
The plow that fertilizes the soil
And the honor-saving sword.

May you live long and prosper, Ind. Rep. of the ^3!
Oh Ind. Rep. of the ^3! may God uphold thee.
